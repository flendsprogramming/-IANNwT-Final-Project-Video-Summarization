# IANNwT-Final-Project-Video-Summarization

Everyday, people watch tons of videos to get facts and quick information, most times listening through long videos just to get an scope of what is being talked about. 
This VideoSummarizer project aims at providing a qualitative tool that saves a ton of time for people who want a quick summary of what a speech-talk centric video
is all about without wanting to watch through every minutes of it.
